## Overview

This project implements a basic 2D rendering engine using Vulkan, demonstrating fundamental graphics programming concepts and modern C++ practices. The engine features a simple particle system that spawns and animates colored triangles.

### Key Features
- Vulkan-based rendering pipeline
- Modern C++ (C++17) implementation
- GLFW window management
- Dynamic triangle spawning and animation
- Custom shader implementation
- Efficient memory management

### Component Relationships
- `Engine`: Main application class that coordinates all components
- `Window`: Handles window creation and input events
- `VulkanInstance`: Manages Vulkan instance, device, and swap chain
- `Renderer`: Handles rendering pipeline and drawing operations
- `Triangle`: Represents a single triangle with position and color

## Core Components

### 1. Window Management
```cpp
class Window {
    GLFWwindow* window;
    int width;
    int height;
    std::string title;
};
```
- Uses GLFW for cross-platform window management
- Provides a clean interface for window operations
- Handles window events and input

### 2. Vulkan Instance
```cpp
class VulkanInstance {
    VkInstance instance;
    VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice;
    VkDevice device;
    VkSwapchainKHR swapChain;
    // ...
};
```
- Manages Vulkan instance and device creation
- Handles device selection and queue management
- Creates and manages swap chain for double buffering

### 3. Renderer
```cpp
class Renderer {
    VkPipeline graphicsPipeline;
    VkBuffer vertexBuffer;
    VkDeviceMemory vertexBufferMemory;
    // ...
};
```
- Implements the graphics pipeline
- Manages vertex buffers and shader modules
- Handles command buffer recording and submission

### 4. Triangle System
```cpp
class Triangle {
    glm::vec2 position;
    glm::vec3 color;
    const float fallSpeed;
};
```
- Represents individual triangles
- Handles position updates and vertex generation
- Manages color properties

## Implementation Details

### 1. Vertex Structure
```cpp
struct Vertex {
    glm::vec2 pos;
    glm::vec3 color;
};
```
- Uses GLM for vector mathematics
- Optimized for memory layout
- Supports position and color attributes

### 2. Shader Implementation
```glsl
#version 450
layout(location = 0) in vec2 inPosition;
layout(location = 1) in vec3 inColor;
layout(location = 0) out vec3 fragColor;

void main() {
    vec2 clipPos = vec2(
        (inPosition.x / 800.0) * 2.0 - 1.0,
        -((inPosition.y / 600.0) * 2.0 - 1.0)
    );
    gl_Position = vec4(clipPos, 0.0, 1.0);
    fragColor = inColor;
}
```
- Implements screen-to-clip space transformation
- Handles color interpolation
- Uses modern GLSL version (450)

### 3. Memory Management
- Uses RAII principles for resource management
- Implements proper cleanup in destructors
- Handles memory allocation and deallocation safely

## Design Choices

### 1. Why Vulkan?
- Modern, low-level graphics API
- Better performance than OpenGL
- More explicit control over the graphics pipeline
- Better suited for modern graphics applications

### 2. Why C++17?
- Modern features like structured bindings
- Improved type safety
- Better performance characteristics
- Rich standard library

### 3. Why GLFW?
- Cross-platform window management
- Simple and clean API
- Good integration with Vulkan
- Lightweight and efficient

### 4. Why Triangles?
- Simple to implement and understand
- Good for demonstrating basic graphics concepts
- Easy to extend with more complex shapes
- Efficient for rendering

### 5. Why Screen Coordinates?
- More intuitive for 2D applications
- Easier to work with window dimensions
- Simpler collision detection
- Better for UI elements

## Future Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- Implement instanced rendering
- Add vertex buffer pooling
- Optimize shader compilation
- Add command buffer reuse

### 2. Feature Additions
- Add texture support
- Implement sprite batching
- Add particle effects
- Support for more shapes

### 3. Architecture Improvements

- Add resource management
- Support for multiple render passes

### 4. Developer Experience
- Add logging system
- Implement debug visualization
- Add configuration system
- Improve error handling

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a solid foundation for a 2D graphics engine using modern graphics programming techniques. The architecture is modular and extensible, making it suitable for further development and feature additions.

The choice of Vulkan, C++17, and GLFW provides a robust foundation for graphics programming, while the triangle-based rendering system offers a simple yet effective way to demonstrate core concepts.
